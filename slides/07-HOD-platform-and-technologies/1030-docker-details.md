## Docker

- Wrap up a piece of software in a isolated runtime
- Guarantee it will always run the same on any environment
- No more Puppet or Chef

note:
- Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, 
runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything you can install on a server
- This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in
- NO MORE WORRYING ABOUT PUPPET/CHEF/ANSIBLE, EITHER YOUR CONTAINER IS UP, OR IT ISN’T
