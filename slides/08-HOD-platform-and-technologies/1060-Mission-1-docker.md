## Mission 1! Getting started with Docker

1. You be assigned a repo `hello-world-x` so pull it down locally

1. Dockerise this simple NodeJS application (you can use one of your own applications if you like!)​
https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/node-hello-world ​

1. Run the dockerfile and verify the app is running on localhost 4000
