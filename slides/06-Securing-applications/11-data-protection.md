## Data protection
You need to:

- Know the retention and removal policy​
- Know what data is stored where
- Know who will be accessing the service and how
- Store and use the minimum amount of data required to fulfil the user need​
- Implement a need to know policy

**The Information Asset Owner (IAO) is the ultimate decision maker**

note:
- Understand the data that will be used, its retention and removal policy​
- Be aware of what data is stored where - our data isn’t always stored in our premises and in the UK ​
- Understand who will be accessing the service / data, with what devices via what networks / 3rd party services​
- Only store and use the minimum amount of data required to fulfil the user need​
- Restrict users to only being able to view the data they need​
- Understanding who Information Asset Owner will drive some of ^^^ decisions

the service manager for your project can tell you who the IAO is​
