## When is it ok to not open source?

[GDS recommend not opening up](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/10/08/when-is-it-ok-not-to-open-all-source-code/):

- Config that relates to security, versions, firewalls
- Code that performs a security enforcing function
- Code that might reveal unannounced policy (build it for open, just don't release yet)
