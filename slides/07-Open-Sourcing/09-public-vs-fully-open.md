## Public Code vs Full Open

- Fully open sourced (as opposed to 'coding in the open') means supporting a community
- Good practice for open source code should include:
  - Documentation
  - Contrib Guidelines
  - Appropriate licence (we use [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
  - Communicate!
